    "## Feature Engineering and Encoding\n",
    "A core contribution of this work is the engineering of a comprehensive feature set that translates biological sequences into machine-readable vectors. We developed three distinct encoding schemes for the TCR CDR3 amino acid sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **One-Hot Encoding:** This method creates a sparse binary matrix representing the presence or absence of specific amino acids at each position in the sequence. It preserves exact positional information, which is crucial for structural motifs, but results in high-dimensional, sparse vectors.\n",
    "2.  **K-mer Frequency Encoding:** We decomposed sequences into overlapping substrings of length $k$ (k-mers, with $k=3$). We then calculated the frequency of each unique 3-mer in the sequence. This approach captures short, local structural motifs (e.g., \"CAS\", \"ASS\") that may be shared across different TCRs with similar antigen specificity, regardless of their exact position.\n",
    "3.  **Physicochemical Property Encoding:** To capture the biophysical nature of the TCR-antigen interaction, we mapped each amino acid to a vector of physicochemical properties, including hydrophobicity, molecular weight, isoelectric point, and polarity. We then aggregated these values (e.g., mean, sum) across the CDR3 sequence. This results in a dense, low-dimensional representation that reflects the \"binding potential\" of the receptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "These TCR features were concatenated with the top 50 Principal Components (PCs) derived from the gene expression data to form the \"Comprehensive\" feature set."

    "## Supervised Classification of Immunotherapy Response\n",
    "The core predictive task was formulated as a binary classification problem: predicting the patient response label (Responder vs. Non-Responder) for each individual cell. We evaluated a diverse suite of algorithms:\n",
    "*   **Logistic Regression:** A linear baseline model.\n",
    "*   **Decision Trees:** A simple, interpretable non-linear model.\n",
    "*   **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees that reduces overfitting.\n",
    "*   **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** A highly optimized gradient boosting framework known for strong performance on tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Setup\n",
    "We designed our experiments to isolate the predictive value of different data modalities. We trained and evaluated models on four nested feature sets:\n",
    "1.  **Baseline:** Technical covariates only (e.g., mitochondrial percentage, library size).\n",
    "2.  **Gene-Enhanced:** Baseline + Gene Expression PCs.\n",
    "3.  **TCR-Enhanced:** Baseline + TCR Encodings (One-hot, K-mer, Physicochemical).\n",
    "4.  **Comprehensive:** Baseline + Gene Expression PCs + TCR Encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation Strategy (Updated)\n",
    "To obtain patient-level generalization estimates and to avoid data leakage between cells from the same patient, we use a Leave-One-Patient-Out (LOPO) cross-validation as the outer evaluation loop. Hyperparameter tuning is performed within the training partitions using GroupKFold (grouped by patient) when possible, falling back to stratified folds only when the number of training patients is too small for grouped splits. Feature scaling and imputation are fit on training partitions only and applied to held-out patient data to ensure leakage-free evaluation."

    "### Comparison with I-SPY2 Trial Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The I-SPY2 trial (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis 2) is a landmark adaptive phase II neoadjuvant trial for high-risk early-stage breast cancer that has significantly informed our understanding of immunotherapy in HR+ disease:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key I-SPY2 Findings Relevant to This Study:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pembrolizumab Combinations (I-SPY2 Arm D):**\n",
    "   - The I-SPY2 trial demonstrated that adding pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates across breast cancer subtypes\n",
    "   - In HR+/HER2- disease, pCR rates increased from ~13% to ~28% with pembrolizumab addition\n",
    "   - This matches the clinical context of our GSE300475 cohort from the DFCI 16-466 trial (NCT02999477)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Biomarker Discovery:**\n",
    "   - I-SPY2 identified immune gene expression signatures predictive of response\n",
    "   - The Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signature correlated with response across subtypes\n",
    "   - HLA class II expression (including HLA-DR) emerged as a key biomarker\n",
    "   - These findings are directly validated by our Task 3 analysis showing HLA-DR and ISG enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Immune Infiltration Patterns:**\n",
    "   - Higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) counts at baseline predicted response\n",
    "   - Dynamic changes in immune cell composition during treatment correlated with outcome\n",
    "   - Our single-cell analysis captures these dynamics at unprecedented resolution\n",

    "- Key reference: Marks et al., Nature Methods 2024\n",

    "**CoNGA (Clonotype Neighbor Graph Analysis):**\n",
    "- Developed by the Bhardwaj and Bradley labs\n",
    "- Simultaneously analyzes gene expression and TCR sequence similarity\n",
    "- Creates a joint graph connecting cells by both transcriptomic similarity AND clonotype relatedness\n",
    "- Identifies \"dual-hit\" cells enriched for tumor-reactive phenotypes\n",
    "- Our combined gene+TCR encoding approach follows similar multimodal integration principles\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Added safety defaults** for missing `adata.obsm` keys (e.g. `X_gene_umap`, `X_gene_svd`, TCR arrays) to avoid KeyError during feature assembly.\n",
    "- **Inserted a safe getter** `_get_obsm_or_zeros(adata, key, mask, n_cols)` to retrieve `obsm` arrays with a zeros fallback.\n",
    "- **Replaced unsafe monkeypatch** of `xgboost.XGBClassifier.__init__` with a **sklearn-compatible wrapper** `XGBClassifierSK` and adjusted `_apply_gpu_patches()` to use it when available.\n",

    "  - **Feed-forward MLP:** Dense network for tabular / flattened sequence inputs.\n",

    "  - **XGBoost on the comprehensive feature set** with nested Group/LOPO CV, the expanded hyperparameter grid (n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample, colsample_bytree), and **patient-level aggregation** (mean cell probabilities -> patient prediction). This gives best performance and interpretable feature importance.\n",
